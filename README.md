# âœ… Boolean Compiler
A compiler for a programming language working with boolean expressions.
- `./hw01.pdf` contains the guidelines and the compiler's desired behavior;
- `./inputs/` sample instances;
- `./outputs/` the corresponding outputs.  
  
The compiler is run using the command `python table.py <path-to-input>`.
